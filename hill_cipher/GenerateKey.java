//Hill are the first Classical that Generate key instead of user input Source:trustmebro

// Does Hill use String->keyMatrix , keyMatrix only? Keymatrix, code that use string is false not following standards

//we need to check det(K), determinent of KeyMatrix, det(K) != 0

//plaintext must be multiple of KeyMatrix size, like multiple of 2 or 3, 
    //if not if plaintext in primenumber then you have to padding
    // do I need to check if plaintext is divisible to 1,2,3,4.. t
        //then it will always divisable, so i think we need to make sure the key is in small dimension, 2 ,3,4, 4 , dont interate less than 3
        //standard of keyMatrix, must be SquareMatrix, because inversible,. S can decrypt it using multiple dimension of Key


//A.adj(A) = det(A) because A-1 = Adj(A)/det(A)
